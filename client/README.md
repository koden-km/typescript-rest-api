# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a very basic project to implement a UI using React and TypeScript that
interacts with a basic REST api. It just uses an in memory array of users for
data storage.

## Run the api server

First ensure the REST api server is running.

```shell
cd ../server/
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Run the client

When the server starts it will provide a URL for the basic site.

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Output**

```
  VITE v6.3.5  ready in 106 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```
